## Geant4 Silicon Detector Simulation

This project uses Geant4 to simulate the motion of charged particles (such as ions) through a stack of Micron Semiconductor W1 silicon strip detectors. It models the geometry, electric field interactions, and detector responses in a vacuum environment.

---

## Overview

The simulation includes:

- A low-density vacuum world volume (`G4_Galactic` material).
- A uniform electric field region to simulate the acceleration of charged particles.  
Note: This is currently disabled — the electric field is handled by SIMION.
- Six detector stacks placed along the z-axis:
  - 4 thin detectors (40 μm thick).
  - 2 thick detectors (300 μm thick).

## Particle Input

Particles are not randomly generated by Geant4 but are read from an external file (provided by SIMION).

The simulation reads position, momenta, and kinetic energy from a file named:

`particle_data.txt`

This file must be placed in the same directory as the executable when running the simulation.  
On Windows builds using CMake with a Release configuration, this typically means the file should be located in:

`<build-dir>/Release/particle_data.txt`

Each line in the file should contain a tab-separated list of values in the following format:
